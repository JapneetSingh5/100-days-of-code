**Thoughts:**\
1.Will continue with #100DaysOfSwiftUI, full steam ahead! I'm vvv excited for moonshot, definitely building it tomorrow!\
2.CoViDtracker 👀, having some issues with reload and stufff, API calls arent great rn, probably needs a thorough refactor! Will probably do it once Moonshot is done; I will have more Codable experience by then! \
3.BSW Bot responsiveness and minor requested changes, enquire about content missing\
4.Will try to move forward in DSA, probably Greedy Algos or in NodeJs or both or UI/UX idk lol too many options\

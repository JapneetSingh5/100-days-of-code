# 100 Days Of Code - Log for R1

### Day 12: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: \
1.Worked on the parallax template for porty, will probably be donw tomorrow\
2.Continue coding up the BSW Website, added the carousel,\
3.Got follow up from the java assignment, have made a correction to the pull request\
4.Added an events tab to the IITD WebApp, can't wait to get back working on it\
**Thoughts:** \
1.Will give some time to porty parallax template i guess, would be done with 90% work in porty with that\
2.Will add the more info page to the hostels tab in IITD WebApp, its coming pretty close to a full blown web app now, and it excites me so much now!!!\
3.Will continue working on the BSW Website, will make the pills/tabs/quick-links nav tomorrow, possibly play around with the sticky notes part too, as they are in the same section\
4.Will continue(or possibly start ?) learning PHP+SQL databases and some great concepts too along with it, yeah, will get back to it now\
Will try to do the above tasks lol, in order of priority!
I am working on so much together, I feel great to be in the thick of things rn, keeping busy, but learning and strengthening theory is what I really do miss, things will get clearer once I am done with my bit in Porty perhaps!
